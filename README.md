# Dev instructions

These are just notes to myself.  //TODO: rewrite this section so it's useful to people who are not me.

Use ec2tunnel alias to set up a tunnel (it's already rigged up to slack on the ktest team)

Slack setup:
- Creat an app
- Add a bot user
- Add an event subscription
  - Use the *bot event* for messages.channel
<!--- Add event subscription-->
  <!--- Enter hostname (verification should happen automatically now)-->
  <!--- Add messages.channel permission-->
